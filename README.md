## What is #301DaysOfCode?
Want to go from code noob to employed developer in less than a year?

Take the **#301DaysOfCode** and go from Code newbie to an employed Developer in less than a year. The only stipulation: code 3 minutes and 1 second per day for 301 days. Wait! What? Why so little? Check out the FAQ below.

To join in, use the **#301DaysOfCode** hashtag on any social network to tell people how much ass you are kicking this year!

## FAQ:

### Only Code for 3 minutes 1 second per day, Are you crazy?

Of course, I am! But so is the human mind. Did you know that you are more likely to stick with a habit if you keep the barrier to entry low? Just like with exercise we are not trying to max ourselves out every day. Start small with 3min 1 sec. If you only did that; great! If you want to do longer for that day, even better. ðŸ˜‰

### Why 301 Days? Why not 365?

We spend 301 days learning to code. The remaining 64 days of the year are focused on landing a front-end developer job.

Cheers if you got the 301 redirect reference. ðŸ˜‰

### I think I should join #301DaysOfCode. But it seems I'm behind, can I still join?

Totally, amigo! Join any time of the year. The vision of **#301DaysOfCode** is to get you coding consistently and land you a developer job â€“ if you want one. Everyone is starting at different times and may be working on their own projects. Join us in the consistent code movement. ðŸ™‚

### I'm doing #100DaysOfCode. Can I do #301DaysOfCode too?

Of course, my friend! Most people doing **#100DaysOfCode** are also doing **#301DaysOfCode**.

**#100DaysOfCode** is focused on getting you to form a coding habit, which is awesome, but requires you to know Git right from the start.

**#301DaysOfCode** is focused on taking you from knowing nothing to landing a developer job within a year.

### Is #301DaysOfCode aimed at learning any particular technology/stack?

**#301DaysOfCode** is not aimed at any particular technology. Most people taking the challenge are aiming at learning Web Development, but you can choose any field in programming. The main motive is to become a developer and get hired at the end of the Year.
